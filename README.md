# 🛡️ Analysis of Network Hardening – Social Media Company Case Study

## 🔍 Overview
This project investigates a major data breach at a social media company due to weak security configurations. As a security analyst, I conducted a risk assessment, identified vulnerabilities, selected hardening tools, and proposed actionable recommendations to improve the organization’s security posture.

## 🧠 Scenario Summary
The organization suffered a data breach that compromised customers' personal information. The following vulnerabilities were discovered:

- Employees shared passwords.
- Default admin password was still in use.
- Firewall rules were missing for traffic filtering.
- Multifactor authentication (MFA) was not implemented.

## 🔐 Selected Network Hardening Tools & Methods

| Tool/Method                 | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Network Access Privileges** | Enforced role-based access to limit user permissions.                  |
| **Password Policies**         | Strengthened password security and ensured regular updates.            |
| **Firewall Maintenance**      | Created firewall rules to filter both inbound and outbound traffic.     |
| **Multifactor Authentication**| Added an extra layer of verification beyond passwords.                 |
| **Network Log Analysis**      | Monitored logs to detect abnormal activity and potential intrusions.    |

## 💡 Recommendations & Justification
- **Firewalls**: Properly configured firewall rules block malicious and unauthorized traffic at network boundaries.
- **IAM Policies**: Role-based access reduces insider threats and ensures only necessary access is granted.
- **MFA**: Helps prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.
- **Log Monitoring**: Early detection of suspicious behavior enhances incident response.
